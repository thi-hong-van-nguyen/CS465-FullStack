# CS465-FullStack

## Architecture:

### Types of Frontend Development: 
In the full-stack project, we utilized Express HTML, JavaScript, and a single-page application (SPA). Express HTML was used for server-side rendering of dynamic content, JavaScript for client-side scripting and interactivity, and the SPA approach for creating highly responsive user interfaces that fetch data asynchronously without page reloads. Express HTML provided traditional server-rendered pages, while the SPA leveraged frameworks like React or Angular for client-side rendering.
### Why MongoDB?: 
The backend utilized a NoSQL MongoDB database due to its flexibility and scalability. NoSQL databases like MongoDB are schema-less, allowing for easy adaptation to evolving data structures. This flexibility is advantageous in applications where data models may change frequently or where there is a need to handle diverse data types efficiently. Additionally, MongoDB's horizontal scalability makes it suitable for handling large volumes of data and supporting high-traffic applications.

## Functionality:

### JSON vs. JavaScript: 
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format derived from JavaScript. While JavaScript is a programming language used for creating dynamic web content and client-side interactions, JSON is primarily a data format used for transmitting data between a server and a client. JSON ties together frontend and backend development pieces by providing a standardized format for data exchange. It allows the frontend and backend to communicate seamlessly, as both can easily parse and manipulate JSON data.
### Refactoring for Efficiency: 
Throughout the full-stack development process, we refactored code to improve functionality and efficiency. For example, we modularized code into reusable components to avoid code duplication and enhance maintainability. Benefits of reusable UI components include improved code organization, easier debugging, and faster development cycles. By encapsulating UI logic into reusable components, we achieved cleaner and more maintainable codebases.
